### Hi

I am a software / systems engineer with a passion for problem solving.

With over a decade of experience as a software engineer, I thrive at the 
intersection system architecture, low-level engineering, and strategic 
leadership  to solve impactful problems.

I like cloud and space. I've worked as software and systems engineer in 
aerospace, cloud, fintech, and startups, which has given me a breadth 
of technical, system, and management knowledge.
