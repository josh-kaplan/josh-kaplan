### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software / systems engineer with a passion for problem solving.

My professional interests revolve around building successful engineering 
teams and all the things that influence team success, both technical and social.

With over a decade of experience building engineering teams, my technical 
expertise in software and digital engineering focuses on DevOps, 
Agile-based methodologies, and applying systems engineering and architecture 
best practices to create systems that balance reliability, performance, and 
maintainability.
